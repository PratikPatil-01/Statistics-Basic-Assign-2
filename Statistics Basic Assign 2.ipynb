    "Mean: The mean is the arithmetic average of all the values in a dataset. It is calculated by summing up all the values and dividing by the total number of values. The mean is sensitive to outliers, meaning that extreme values can greatly influence its value. It is commonly used when the data is normally distributed or approximately symmetrically distributed.\n",

    "Mode: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. A dataset can have one mode (unimodal), two modes (bimodal), or more than two modes (multimodal).

    "These measures are used to provide a single value that represents the central or typical value of a dataset. Depending on the distribution and characteristics of the data, one or more of these measures may be appropriate. For example, in a dataset with a symmetrical distribution and no outliers, the mean may be a suitable measure of central tendency. However, in a dataset with skewed distribution or outliers, the median may provide a better representation. The mode is often used in categorical data or when identifying the most common value or category."

    "</br>\n",
    "Covariance measures the extent to which two variables change together. It indicates the direction of the linear relationship between two variables (positive or negative) but does not provide information about the strength of the relationship.</br>\n",
    "Correlation measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. It standardizes the covariance by dividing it by the product of the standard deviations of the two variables, resulting in a value between -1 and 1.</br>\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "Scale:\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "Covariance is not standardized and can take any value, positive, negative, or zero. The magnitude of covariance depends on the scale of the variables, making it difficult to interpret and compare across different datasets.</br>\n",
    "Correlation is standardized and ranges from -1 to 1. A correlation coefficient of 1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, and 0 indicates no linear relationship. The closer the correlation coefficient is to 1 or -1, the stronger the linear relationship.</br>\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "Covariance indicates the direction of the relationship between two variables (positive or negative) but does not provide information about the strength of the relationship.</br>\n",
    "A positive covariance indicates a positive relationship (both variables increase or decrease together), a negative covariance indicates a negative relationship (one variable increases while the other decreases), and zero covariance indicates no linear relationship.</br>\n",
    "Correlation provides a standardized measure of the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. It is easier to interpret and compare across different datasets because it is standardized and ranges from -1 to 1.\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "Units:\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "Covariance is expressed in the units of the variables being measured.</br>\n",
    "Correlation is a dimensionless measure and does not have any units.</br>\n",
    "In summary, while covariance and correlation both measure the relationship between two variables, correlation provides a more standardized and interpretable measure of the strength and direction of the linear relationship, making it more widely used in statistical analysis and interpretation."
